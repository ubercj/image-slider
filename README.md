# Image Slider

This was a quick exercise to practice my vanilla JS skills by creating one of those popular image slideshows/carousels. I used the `transform: translate()` CSS property and CSS transitions to slide the photos around within a `div` with `overflow-x: hidden` acting as a sort of "frame." I used `window.setInterval` for the auto-scrolling slideshow.
